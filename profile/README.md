**End-to-End Physical AI Solutions — From Silicon to Product**

---

## Who We Are

PolarLink is a Physical AI company delivering **vertically integrated solutions** across the entire technology stack. From custom silicon design to intelligent software and final robotic products, we own every layer of the stack—enabling unmatched optimization, seamless integration, and rapid innovation.

## Our Vertical Approach

What sets PolarLink apart is our ability to deliver complete solutions without relying on fragmented supply chains or third-party dependencies.

## What We Do

### 💻 Software Development
We build the intelligent software that powers our systems—from low-level firmware and device drivers to AI/ML pipelines, robotics middleware, and cloud platforms. Our software engineers work hand-in-hand with hardware teams to squeeze every ounce of performance from our custom silicon.

### 🔬 Silicon Design
Our custom chips are purpose-built for edge AI applications, delivering exceptional performance-per-watt for real-time inference and control. By designing our own silicon, we achieve optimizations impossible with off-the-shelf solutions.

### 🤖 Robotics & Hardware
We design and manufacture robotic systems engineered for reliability in real-world environments. Our hardware integrates seamlessly with our software stack and custom silicon, creating cohesive products rather than assembled components.

### 🧠 Physical AI
At the core of everything is Physical AI—the fusion of machine learning with real-world actuation. Our vertical integration allows us to optimize AI models specifically for our silicon, deploy them through our software stack, and execute them on our robotic hardware.

## Why Vertical Integration Matters

- **Performance**: Hardware-software co-design enables optimizations impossible with off-the-shelf components
- **Speed**: No waiting on third-party vendors—we iterate across the entire stack
- **Quality**: End-to-end ownership means end-to-end accountability
- **Innovation**: Breakthroughs at any layer can be instantly leveraged across the product
